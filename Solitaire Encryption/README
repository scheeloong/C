First clean the directory 
>> make clean
Compile the directory 
>> make
Encrypt the message in file secret_decrypt.txt using deck1.txt as the key 
>> ./sol -e -d deck1.txt -m secret_decrypt.txt
Now, Decrypt the message in file secret.txt using the same key (deck1.txt) 
>> ./sol -d -d deck1.txt -m secret.txt
You should see that the encrypted message for secret_decrypt.txt is the same as secret.txt
Similarly, the decrypted message for secret.txt is the same as secret_decrypt.txt
